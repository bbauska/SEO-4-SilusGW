1. Use keyword research to guide your SEO landing pages’ content
Keyword research is a critical first step to creating your SEO landing pages. Start by identifying 
long-tail keywords relevant to your business and products. Not sure what keywords your audience is 
using? Use keyword research tools like KeywordsFX.

Create content based on these keywords, ensuring you’re addressing the search intent behind the 
keywords. Google’s Helpful Content Update aims to deliver more relevant and valuable information 
to searchers, so the more helpful your landing page content is, the higher its chances of ranking. 
This algorithm update also means content written for humans will rank higher than content created 
for search engines.

Use the keywords in your written content, but avoid overusing them! Search engines can detect 
keyword stuffing, which won’t help you rank.

Instead, identify secondary keywords that you can use within your content. These keywords should 
add context to your SEO landing page and support your primary long-tail keyword.

For example, let’s say you’re an immigration lawyer practicing in Austin, Texas. Your SEO company 
for lawyers may suggest you optimize for your primary keyword “immigration lawyer in Austin” and 
secondary keywords like “immigration lawyer in Austin with free consultation.”



2. Help search engines understand your content structure
While your SEO landing pages are created for your prospects to consume, make sure you make them 
easy for web crawlers to read and analyze your landing pages’ structure. Doing so helps the bots 
understand what your landing pages are about and index them appropriately.

Make sure your landing pages have the following:

  - Title tag: Keep your landing page’s title tag concise. Frontload your primary keyword in 
      your title tag as much as possible.
  - Meta description: Your meta description may appear in SERPs, thus helping convince a 
      searcher to click your landing page. It is also a search ranking factor, so mention 
	  your primary keyword here.
  - Headings: Use subheads within your content to break up text and make them easier to read. 
      They also give search engines additional context about your landing page.
  - Internal links: Internal links give search engines additional context about your SEO landing 
      page. They also help spread link juice among your pages. Ensure your relevant internal 
	  links use anchor text related to the content.
  - Alt tags: Add descriptive alt tags to your images so web crawlers can “read” your SEO 
      landing pages’ images.
  - Keyword-optimized URL: Use your SEO landing page’s URL to give searchers and search 
      engines an idea about what your page is about.
  - Earn good backlinks: Backlinks are links from other websites to yours. Earning a backlink 
      from a reputable site proves that you’re a trustworthy business and will boost your 
	  page’s SEO.

3. Make your SEO landing pages mobile-friendly
With more than 52% of website traffic coming from mobile phones, it’s important to have mobile-
friendly SEO landing pages. Make it easy for your visitors to convert by having a page that 
shows your CTA correctly, no matter the size of their device, thus enabling visitors to perform 
your desired action.

Mobile-friendly pages are also likely to rank on SERPs because Google uses mobile-first indexing. 
Not sure if your SEO landing pages are mobile-friendly? Run them through Google’s Mobile-Friendly 
Test tool.

4. Mind your page load speed
Page speed is an important SEO ranking factor that Google admits to using, so your SEO landing 
page must have an acceptable load speed. Stats say 83% of users expect websites to load in 
three seconds or less.

Here are a few tips to improve your page’s load speed by:

  - Optimizing your images: Compress your page’s images to make the file size smaller without 
      the quality of the photo. This is an efficient way to ensure that you can keep your current 
	  photos.
  - Reducing HTTP requests: Your page takes time to download content, scripts, and other site 
      components. This is an HTTP request. Minimize your page’s components, because the more 
	  components your page has, the longer it takes your page to load.
  - Minimizing redirects: Redirects are a great fix to prevent site visitors from clicking on 
      broken links. However, too many redirects can impact your page’s speed. Work on keeping 
	  your redirects to a minimum.

5. Make each landing page unique
SEO landing pages are typically part of a bigger marketing campaign, and some keywords may be 
related to one another. Despite the similarities, ensure every landing page is about 80% unique 
so that search engines won’t think they’re duplicate pages.

For example, let’s say you’re in the business of vacation rentals in different cities. Your 
offerings are almost alike except for their locations. Employ clever copywriting to differentiate 
one SEO landing page from another.

6. Monitor your SEO landing pages’ performance
Are your SEO landing pages ranking on SERPs and attracting clicks? Use Google Search Console to 
determine which ones rank for your target keywords.

Google Analytics, meanwhile, can tell you the number of unique users who landed on your page. If 
you want to know the number of conversions a landing page generates, you can also turn to Google 
Analytics.

RevenueCloudFX is another tool you can use to measure your SEO landing pages’ performance. It 
can monitor your pages’ overall search engine performance and current keyword rankings. With 
the power of artificial intelligence, RevenueCloudFX can also provide data-driven recommendations 
to improve your SEO landing page.

What is an SEO Statement of Work?
An SEO SOW is a detailed document that provides an overview of your SEO project. It outlines 
everything that your marketing agency agrees to do for you before starting on your SEO strategy. 
Think of it like the game plan against a rival team — it lays out exactly what your agency will 
do to help you win in the search engine results.

What’s included in an SEO statement of work?
When you ask for an SEO Statement of Work, what can you expect to see in it? Here are a few 
things that you want to see in your document:

1. Goals
First and foremost, your SEO Statement of Work should directly address your goals. When you 
invest in SEO, you have specific goals you want to achieve — that could be smaller goals like 
increasing traffic and leads or bigger goals like increasing revenue and bottom-line business 
growth.

Think about why you’re hiring an SEO agency in the first place — what do you want them to help 
you accomplish? The answer to that question should be laid out in the goals section of your SEO 
Statement of Work.

Keep in mind, too, that your agency may lay out your larger goals and then set smaller goals to 
help you achieve those big goals. If you want to increase revenue, for example, your agency might 
set smaller goals to increase brand visibility or boost search rankings to help you meet those 
larger goals.

2. Summary of how the work will be completed
This section is a key component of the SEO SOW — it should detail your campaign strategy and 
timeline for completing the tasks at hand.

You should see information like:

  - What tasks your SEO agency will complete for your business
  - What processes will be used to complete tasks (keyword research, content creation, etc.)
  - Timeline for completing projects
  - How your SEO agency plans to report results

Basically, this section details what tactics your agency will use to help you with your SEO and 
when they expect to complete different projects.

3. Deliverables
Another key component of an SEO SOW is the deliverables section. This section provides the nitty-
gritty details of what your SEO company will actually be doing for your campaigns.

Some common deliverables include things like:

  - Conducting a competitor analysis
  - Auditing your current SEO strategy
  - Producing industry-relevant, targeted content
  - Optimizing your title tags and meta descriptions 
  - Delivering monthly reports on marketing performance

Basically, the deliverables highlight exactly what tasks your agency plans to do to help you 
achieve your SEO goals.

So, with keyword research as an example, the process is to conduct keyword research to identify 
high value keywords. The deliverable is the industry-relevant, keyword-targeted content you get 
for your website.

4. Who’s working on your strategy
A good SEO Statement of Work will include details about who’s working on your strategy. 
The details of this will depend upon the agency.

Some agencies will detail the types of people working on your campaign, like an SEO strategist, 
content writer, and conversion specialist. Other agencies will detail exactly who you’re working 
with so you can put a name to the position.

Generally, you want to see multiple people working on your strategy. A typical team might include:

  - An account manager who coordinates with you on your campaigns and keeps you up to date
  - An SEO strategist that’s skilled in the strategy and manages most of your tactics
  - A content writer who helps create content for your business
  - A content editor that polishes content before it’s published on your website
  - A conversion specialist who helps identify opportunities to earn more revenue with SEO

How your team looks depends on the agency and the scope of SEO work you need for your strategy. 
Regardless, your SEO SOW should provide details on what kinds of specialists are working on your 
campaign.

<h2>What shouldn’t be in an SEO Statement of Work?</h2>
An SEO Statement of Work can look different depending on the company and level of detail they 
provide. So, it’s important to understand what you don’t want to see in your statement.

Here are a few red flags to look out for:

Guaranteed specific rankings: If you see the agency guaranteeing specific rankings anywhere 
(“We’ll get you ranking #1!”) in your statement — run. No agency can guarantee positioning in 
the search results, so any agency that does is likely using black-hat SEO techniques that will 
ultimately hurt your business.

An emphasis on quantity over quality: Another red flag is if your agency’s statement focuses 
heavily on the quantity of leads over the quality. This emphasis could indicate they’re using 
less-than-ethical strategies to inflate performance numbers, without actually delivering results. 
Ideally, you want a balance of both quantity and quality, but at the very least, quality should 
be the focus.

Cookie-cutter approaches: It’s a common problem in SEO, so you need to look out for it. If your 
SEO Statement of Work doesn’t show an approach tailored to your business, that agency won’t be 
a good fit for you. Don’t settle for cookie-cutter plans — make sure your campaign approach is 
tailored to you.

Lack of pricing detail: If you’re at the point where you’re ready to hire a certain agency, you 
should know how much it costs. Your SEO SOW should include some details about the cost of your 
strategy. Keep a lookout for hidden fees — some agencies might try to slide them in without you 
seeing (and that’s not an agency you want to work with!)

No clear plan of communication: If you’re going to hire an SEO agency, you want to ensure 
they’ll keep you updated on what they’re doing. If your SEO statement doesn’t include a clear 
plan of communication, it may not be the right agency for you.
